## Overview
The project primarily focuses on endometriosis, a widespread gynaecological condition where tissue similar to the womb lining develops elsewhere, such as in the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This condition is one of great health mimickers in women, it can lead to various painful symptoms while simultaneously escaping detection via scans and examinations. The disease can affect women of all ages, including teenagers, and it often takes over a decade to receive a diagnosis. This project applies deep learning techniques for detecting and localizing endometriosis in laparoscopic images. It addresses the challenge of delayed diagnosis in endometriosis, a condition affecting a significant female population globally.
 ## Objective
To enhance early detection and management of endometriosis using advanced deep learning models that can accurately identify and localize the condition in laparoscopic images.

## Methodology
The research utilizes various deep learning models like EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN, SSD ResNet, MobileNet, and CenterNet, trained on the ITEC Gynecologic Laparoscopy Endometriosis Dataset (GLENDA v1.5).

## Key Outcomes
EfficientDet D1 and CenterNet showed high accuracy in detection.
 While Faster R-CNN and MobileNet excelled in lesion localization.
The models demonstrated potential for improving gynaecological healthcare.
